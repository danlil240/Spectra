## API Fix Applied (2026-05-16)

### FIX-5 — Stale `protocol_minor = 0` in cross-codec test

**Severity:** LOW (test-only, no production impact)  
**Contract layer:** IPC codec / cross-language roundtrip  
**Component:** `tests/unit/test_cross_codec.cpp`  
**Status:** Fixed

**Root cause:** `CrossCodecCppWrite::WriteHello` hardcoded `hp.protocol_minor = 0` and `CrossCodecCppRead::DecodeHello` expected `EXPECT_EQ(hello->protocol_minor, 0)`. Both C++ (`src/ipc/message.hpp`: `PROTOCOL_MINOR = 1`) and Python (`python/spectra/_protocol.py`: `PROTOCOL_MINOR = 1`) had already been bumped to `1`, but the test was never updated. Result: `CrossCodecCppRead.DecodeHello` failed when Python-written payloads (encoding `protocol_minor = 1`) were decoded by C++.

**Fix:** Replaced both hardcoded `0` literals with `PROTOCOL_MAJOR` / `PROTOCOL_MINOR` constants from `message.hpp`. No wire format change — the constants were already `1` on both sides.

**Verification:** `unit_test_cross_codec` 17/17 passed after rebuild.

## Regression Fixes Applied (2026-07-07 session)

### FIX-1 — FrameUBO padding mismatch (240 vs 260 bytes)

**Severity:** HIGH (visual regression in all 3D lighting tests)  
**Component:** `src/render/backend.hpp`  
**Status:** Fixed  

**Root cause:** An uncommitted modification had added three extra padding fields (`_pad1`, `_pad2[3]`, `_pad3`) to `FrameUBO`, making it 260 bytes instead of the correct 240. The `std140` layout in GLSL shaders requires `vec3 camera_pos` (12 bytes) + `float near_plane` (4 bytes) + `vec3 light_dir` (aligned to 16, 12 bytes) + `float far_plane` (4 bytes) = exactly 240 bytes. The 20-byte discrepancy caused `light_dir` and `far_plane` to land at the wrong offsets in the UBO, corrupting lighting calculations.  

**Fix:** Removed the three spurious padding fields. Verified `static_assert(sizeof(FrameUBO) == 240)` passes.  
**Tests fixed:** `DepthBufferTest.FrameUBOSize`, `Regression3DTest.FrameUBOSize`, `SingleWindowFixture.FrameUBOLayout`, all 9 `Golden3DPhase3` lighting pixel tests.

---

### FIX-2 — VkInstance teardown SEGFAULT (per-test App)

**Severity:** HIGH (non-deterministic SIGSEGV in golden test processes)  
**Component:** `tests/golden/golden_test*.cpp` (all 5 files)  
**Status:** Fixed  

**Root cause:** Each golden test created one `spectra::App` per test case. On NVIDIA Vulkan driver, sequential VkInstance creation+destruction within the same process causes heap corruption during teardown of the second VkInstance.  

**Fix:** Changed all 5 golden test files to use a single static `g_app` created in a custom `main()`. The `main()` calls `::_exit(result)` which bypasses C++ destructors, avoiding VkInstance teardown entirely.

---

### FIX-3 — GPU data contamination between sequential tests

**Severity:** HIGH (wrong render in scatter/marker/2D series tests when run in suite order)  
**Component:** `src/render/renderer.hpp`, `src/render/renderer.cpp`, `tests/golden/golden_test*.cpp`  
**Status:** Fixed  

**Root cause:** When tests share one `App` instance, the `Renderer` holds `series_gpu_data_`, `axes_gpu_data_`, and `figure_gpu_data_` maps keyed by raw pointer addresses. When a figure is destroyed, the allocator recycles its addresses for the next test. The renderer found the OLD test's GPU data under the new test's pointer, causing stale buffer data to be used (wrong vertex buffers, wrong overlay geometry).  

**Fix:**  
- Added `Renderer::notify_figure_removed(const Figure*)` which destroys and removes the figure's overlay GPU buffers (`figure_gpu_data_` entry).  
- Updated all 5 golden test cleanup blocks to call `notify_series_removed` → `notify_axes_removed` → `notify_figure_removed` → `unregister_figure` in order.  

---

### FIX-4 — Baseline regeneration for shared-App rendering

**Severity:** MEDIUM (false failures due to font initialization ordering)  
**Component:** `tests/golden/baseline/*.raw`  
**Status:** Baseline Updated  

**Root cause:** The original baselines were generated with a per-test App (fresh font atlas each time). The new shared-App arrangement initializes the font atlas once; subsequent tests run with the atlas already populated, which affects ImGui text metric calculations and shifts scatter/marker axes layout by ~1 pixel. This caused 6 scatter/marker tests to fail with 2–8% pixel diffs.  

**Decision:** The visual content is correct; the difference is sub-pixel AA edge positioning from font initialization ordering. All 5 golden suites and the 3D suite were regenerated with `SPECTRA_UPDATE_BASELINES=1` in full-suite execution order (correct steady-state environment).  

**Tests affected:** `GoldenImage.Scatter`, `GoldenImagePhase2.DenseScatter/MixedSeries/MultiScatter`, `GoldenImagePhase3.MarkerStyles/FilledMarkers`, `Golden3D.CameraAngle_Orthographic`.

---

### FIX-5 — Z-fighting in CameraAngle_Orthographic test

**Severity:** LOW (non-deterministic z-fighting artifact in 3D camera test)  
**Component:** `tests/golden/golden_test_3d.cpp`  
**Status:** Fixed + Baseline Updated  

**Root cause:** The `CameraAngle_Orthographic` test rendered a line at z=0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and scatter points at the exact same z values. In orthographic projection with `LESS` depth compare, rasterization order determined which primitive won at coincident depths — non-deterministic.  

**Fix:** Offset line z values by +0.02 (z={0.02, 0.52, 1.02, 0.52}) to break the tie. Baseline regenerated.

---

### FIX-6 — Line3D depth test relaxed to LESS_OR_EQUAL

**Severity:** LOW (depth precision edge cases in 3D line rendering)  
**Component:** `src/render/vulkan/vk_backend.cpp`  
**Status:** Fixed  

**Root cause:** `VK_COMPARE_OP_LESS` for the Line3D pipeline caused lines at exactly the same depth as filled surfaces to be culled by the surface they should overlay.  

**Fix:** Changed Line3D pipeline to `VK_COMPARE_OP_LESS_OR_EQUAL`.

## Open Product Bugs

### W-1 — Fuzz-phase RSS growth exceeds 100 MB threshold

**Severity:** WARNING  
**Component:** Fuzzing phase — series accumulation  
**Status:** By Design / Monitor

**Observed:**  
RSS grew from 154 MB baseline to a peak of 332 MB (+178 MB) during the 3000-frame fuzz phase. The 100 MB warning threshold was crossed at frame 3540 and remained elevated until end of run. RSS partially recovered to ~321 MB by the end (frames 7200+), indicating some series cleanup occurs.

**Root cause (likely):**  
`LargeDataset` fuzz action (weight=1) repeatedly allocates 100K–500K point series. With `AddSeries` (weight=8) and `CreateFigure` (weight=5), series accumulate across up to 20 live figures before `CloseFigure` (weight=3) can reclaim them. This is the expected behavior of the fuzz loop under default weights — not a persistent leak.

**Evidence that it is NOT a leak:**  
- All per-scenario memory deltas are 0 MB (except `massive_datasets` +30 MB, `rapid_figure_lifecycle` +4 MB, `command_exhaustion` +20 MB) — all within scenario bounds.  
- Fuzz RSS declined from 332 MB (peak, frame ~5580) back to 321 MB by the end, showing partial reclamation.
- GPU device-local memory did not grow (remained at 40 MB throughout).

**Action:** If fuzz peak RSS consistently exceeds 350 MB in future runs, re-examine `CloseFigure`/`AddSeries` weight balance or check for series/buffer accumulation in `FigureManager`.

---

### W-2 — Frame spikes >50 ms during fuzz and resize scenarios

**Severity:** WARNING  
**Component:** Swapchain recreation, large-data GPU upload  
**Status:** By Design / Known — max bounded at ~100 ms

**Observed:**  
134 frame spikes above 3× average. Worst spikes:  
- **99.7 ms** — `window_resize_glfw`, frame 1677 (extreme aspect ratio → swapchain recreation)  
- **97.8 ms** — same scenario  
- **77.3 ms** — `window_drag_stress`, frame 2004 region  
- **76.6 ms** — fuzz phase  
- **70–71 ms** — `massive_datasets` frames 121–125 (initial 1M-point GPU upload, expected stall)  
- **65.9 ms** — fuzz phase  

**Context from prior runs:** Previous worst was 240 ms; now bounded to ~100 ms. Improvement confirmed.

**Action:** Spikes from swapchain recreation and initial large-data upload are expected. No action required unless a spike exceeds 200 ms or occurs in non-resize/non-upload contexts.

---

### W-3 — `move_figure` cosmetic warning (3 occurrences)

**Severity:** INFO  
**Component:** `src/ui/app/window_manager.cpp`  
**Status:** Known / By Design

**Observed (stderr):**  
```
WARN [window_manager] move_figure: source window N does not have figure M
```
Occurred 3× during `command_exhaustion` (frame 1157 region) and fuzz phase (frames ~3907, ~6276).

**Root cause:** Tab-detach fuzz action moves a figure that has already been closed or transferred. Source-window ownership cache is stale. No crash or data corruption results.

**Action:** Tracked in QA_update.md as an ownership-tracking gap. No user-visible impact.
