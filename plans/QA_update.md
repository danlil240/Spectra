## P0 — Critical Fixes

### 1. ~~Frame Time Spike Threshold Is Too Sensitive~~ ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** 93 of 93 issues in Run 1 are frame_time warnings. The 3× EMA threshold triggers on normal VSync frames (~16ms) because early frames run at ~3ms (no VSync yet), dragging the EMA down.
- **Fix applied:** Added warmup period (skip first 30 frames) + absolute minimum threshold (33ms) + 3× EMA multiplier. Result: seed 12345 session now reports only 6 frame_time warnings (all genuine 145–297ms spikes from massive_datasets scenario) vs. 93 false positives before.
- **Priority:** P0 — ✅ Done

### 2. ~~Screenshot Flood~~ ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** 93 screenshots captured, all nearly identical (~87KB each). ~8MB of disk wasted on false positives.
- **Fix applied:** Added `last_screenshot_frame_` map with 60-frame cooldown per category. Combined with fix #1, screenshot count dropped from 93 to ~1-2 per session.
- **Priority:** P0 — ✅ Done

### 3. ~~Crash Handler Needs Stack Trace~~ ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** SIGSEGV in Run 1 only reports seed. No stack trace, no scenario/action context.
- **Fix applied:** (a) `backtrace()` + `backtrace_symbols_fd()` on Linux for stack dump. (b) `g_last_action` global updated before each fuzz action and scenario. (c) Crash report written to `qa_crash.txt` in output dir. (d) Enhanced crash banner with seed, last action, and reproduce command.
- **Verified:** Crash handler now outputs full stack trace + last action context (e.g., `fuzz:MouseClick (frame 245)`).
- **Priority:** P0 — ✅ Done

### 15. ~~Scenario Isolation — Heavyweight Figures Pollute Subsequent Scenarios~~ ✅ FIXED
- **Problem (Session 2, seed 99999):** `massive_datasets` scenario creates a figure with 1M + 5×100K points. This figure stays active during all subsequent scenarios (`undo_redo_stress`, `animation_stress`, etc.), causing 160ms+ avg `cmd_record` time and 3–6 second frame spikes during undo/redo. Only 4/10 scenarios completed within the 90s wall clock.
- **Root cause:** Scenarios that don't create their own figures inherit the active figure from the previous scenario. After `massive_datasets`, the 1.5M-point figure is still the active tab.
- **Fix applied:** Added `ensure_lightweight_active_figure()` helper that creates a small 50-point figure and switches to it. Called at the start of 7 scenarios: `undo_redo_stress`, `animation_stress`, `input_storm`, `command_exhaustion`, `mode_switching`, `stress_docking`, `resize_stress`.
- **Result:** avg frame time dropped from 254ms → 72.5ms (3.5× faster), max spike from 6708ms → 641ms (10.5× better), scenarios completed increased from 4/10 → 8/10, total frames doubled (615 → 1225).
- **File modified:** `tests/qa/qa_agent.cpp`
- **Priority:** P0 — ✅ Done

## Session 2 Findings (2026-02-23)

### Run Summary

| Metric | Before Fix (seed 99999) | After Fix (seed 99999) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Frames | 615 | 1,225 |
| Scenarios | 4/10 passed | 8/10 passed |
| Warnings | 9 | 25 |
| Errors | 0 | 0 |
| Crash | Clean exit | Clean exit |
| RSS growth | +58MB (193→251) | +121MB (168→289) |
| Avg frame | 254ms | 72.5ms |
| P99 frame | 366ms | 504ms |
| Max frame | 6708ms | 641ms |
| cmd_record avg | 160ms | 13.6ms |

### New Issues Found & Fixed
- **C2 — Vulkan device lost (seed 77777, frame 2544):** `readback_framebuffer()` used stale dimensions after resize → out-of-bounds `vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer`. **Fixed:** clamp to actual swapchain extent. See `QA_results.md` C2.
- **C3 — SIGSEGV in Inspector (seed 77777, frame 2732):** Dangling `Series*` in `SelectionContext` after figure close. **Fixed:** added `ImGuiIntegration::clear_figure_cache()` wired to figure-closed callback. See `QA_results.md` C3.
- **V2 — Vulkan validation error:** Descriptor image layout mismatch in multi-window — see `QA_results.md` V2. Still open.
- **Memory growth:** +247MB over 90s session (168→415MB) — needs investigation (M1)
- **imgui_build bottleneck:** After fixing cmd_record, `imgui_build` is now the dominant cost at avg=2.6ms (was 65ms before scenario isolation fix, now reasonable)
- **`move_figure` warning:** "source window does not have figure" — figure ownership tracking issue during fuzzing (cosmetic, no crash)

### Verification Run (seed 77777, after all fixes)

## Session 3 Findings (2026-02-23)

### Run Summary (seed 1771883518, 120s)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Frames | 3,034 |
| Scenarios | 10/10 passed |
| Warnings | 22 |
| Errors | 0 |
| Critical | 0 |
| Crashes | 0 |
| RSS growth | +96MB (170→266MB) |
| Avg frame | 39.0ms |
| P95 frame | 149.6ms |
| Max frame | 463ms |

### Analysis
- **All session 2 fixes confirmed stable** — 0 crashes, 0 critical, 10/10 scenarios
- **First ~2400 frames at 60 FPS with 0 hitches** — scenario isolation fix working perfectly
- **Late-session degradation (frames 2400–3034):** `cmd_record` avg=74ms, 532/600 hitches. Caused by fuzzer's `LargeDataset` action creating 100K–500K point series that becomes the active figure. This is the known H1 issue, not a regression.
- **Memory growth modest:** +96MB vs +247MB in session 2 — fewer heavy figures created by this seed's fuzz sequence
- **No new bugs found**
- **`move_figure` warning** still appears during fuzzing — cosmetic, no crash

---

## Session 4 Findings (2026-02-23)

### Run Summary (seed 1771883726, 120s)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Frames | 3,737 |
| Scenarios | 10/10 passed |
| Warnings | 79 |
| Errors | 0 |
| Critical | 0 |
| Crashes | 0 |
| RSS growth | +274MB (168→442MB) |
| Avg frame | 29.2ms |
| P95 frame | 118.0ms |
| Max frame | 526ms |

### Analysis
- **All fixes stable across 4 consecutive sessions** — 0 crashes, 0 critical
- **Steady-state fuzzing at 66 FPS** with only 3 hitches per 600-frame window
- **Memory growth is the top remaining concern:** +274MB over 120s. The fuzzer creates many figures with `LargeDataset` actions (100K–500K points each) that accumulate. This is the known M1 issue — needs heap profiling to distinguish leaks from expected data growth.
- **79 warnings** (mostly memory growth) — no frame_time warnings during steady-state, only during `massive_datasets` scenario and `LargeDataset` fuzz actions
- **`move_figure` warning** still appears — cosmetic
- **No new bugs found**

---

## Session 5 Findings (2026-02-24)

### Run Summary (seed 1771883913, 120s)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Frames | 1,360 |
| Scenarios | 10/10 passed |
| Warnings | 22 |
| Errors | 0 |
| Critical | 0 |
| Crashes | 0 |
| RSS growth | +68MB (168→236MB) |
| Avg frame | 92.7ms |
| P95 frame | 330ms |
| Max frame | 569ms |

### Analysis
- **5 consecutive sessions with 0 crashes, 0 critical** — all fixes stable
- **Low frame count (1360)** due to `command_exhaustion` + `massive_datasets` scenarios consuming most wall clock. `command_exhaustion` creates windows, exports PNGs, and exercises all commands — `imgui_build` avg=71ms during that scenario.
- **Lowest memory growth yet:** +68MB — this seed's fuzz sequence created fewer heavy figures
- **No new bugs found**
- **Observation:** `command_exhaustion` scenario is disproportionately expensive. Consider adding a frame budget or reducing its command iteration count to leave more wall clock for fuzzing.

## Session 6 Findings (2026-02-24)

### Run Summary (seed 1771884136, 120s)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Frames | 1,368 |
| Scenarios | 10/10 passed |
| Warnings | 27 |
| Errors | 0 |
| Critical | 0 |
| Crashes | 0 |
| RSS growth | +124MB (168→292MB) |
| Avg frame | 90.5ms |
| P95 frame | 337ms |
| Max frame | 444ms |

### Analysis
- **6 consecutive sessions with 0 crashes, 0 critical** — all fixes stable
- **V2 Vulkan validation error reproduced** — descriptor image layout mismatch (`PRESENT_SRC_KHR` vs `UNDEFINED`) during multi-window rendering after `move_figure` failure. No crash, validation error only. Confirms V2 is a real but non-fatal issue.
- **Same pattern as session 5:** low frame count (1368) due to `command_exhaustion` + `massive_datasets` dominating wall clock
- **No new bugs found**

---

## Session 7 Findings (2026-02-24)

### Run Summary

| Metric | Run A (seed 42) | Run B (seed 1771959053) |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Frames | 4,710 | 2,253 |
| Scenarios | 11/11 passed | 11/11 passed |
| Warnings | 92 | 64 |
| Errors | 0 | 0 |
| Critical | 0 | 0 |
| Crashes | 0 | 0 |
| RSS growth | +261MB (168→429MB) | +148MB (168→316MB) |
| Avg frame | 22.6ms | 50.7ms |
| P95 frame | 63.5ms | 225.4ms |
| Max frame | 298.2ms | 1021.9ms |

### Analysis
- **8 consecutive sessions with 0 crashes, 0 critical** — crash fixes remain stable.
- **Known V2 validation issue reproduced again** — `PRESENT_SRC_KHR` vs `UNDEFINED` layout mismatch during multi-window churn; still non-fatal.
- **New severe perf pattern observed (seed 1771959053):** repeated ~1s frame stalls in clusters (frames 250–256, 2170–2174, 2228–2234). Profiler indicates the time is concentrated in `begin_frame`/`vk_acquire`, not `cmd_record`.
- **Memory growth remains highly seed-dependent** (from +148MB to +261MB in 120s), consistent with unresolved M1.

## Session 8 Findings (2026-03-01, Memory Agent)

### Run Summary

| Metric | Before (`seed 42`) | After (`seed 42`) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Mode | `--no-fuzz --duration 60` | `--no-fuzz --duration 60` |
| Frames | 1,909 | 1,929 |
| Scenarios | 15/15 passed | 15/15 passed |
| Peak RSS | 529MB | 337MB |
| RSS delta | +341MB (188→529) | +159MB (178→337) |
| Errors/Critical | 0/0 | 0/0 |

### Analysis
- `command_exhaustion` was retaining allocations by opening windows/figures without teardown.
- Added cleanup in QA harness to return to one window + one lightweight figure after `command_exhaustion`.
- During fix, ASan caught a UAF regression in stale figure caches; this was fixed by explicit cache invalidation across all window UI contexts before closing windows.
- `command_exhaustion` isolated RSS delta improved from `+166MB` (peak 354MB) to `+115MB` (peak 293MB).
- M1 and item #7 remain open, but the baseline contamination source is now reduced.

## Session 9 Findings (2026-03-01, Memory Agent Follow-up)

### Run Summary

| Metric | ASan run (`--no-fuzz --duration 60`) | RSS run (`--no-fuzz --duration 60`) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Frames | 1,188 | 2,492 |
| Scenarios | 6/6 passed | 16/16 passed |
| Peak RSS | 608MB | 338MB |
| RSS delta | +187MB (421→608) | +160MB (178→338) |
| GPU local usage | 28→28MB | 28→28MB |
| Errors/Critical | 0/0 | 0/0 |

### Analysis
- Targeted per-scenario isolation confirms `command_exhaustion` remains the dominant growth source (`+115MB`), while sampled scenarios (`rapid_figure_lifecycle`, `massive_datasets`, `undo_redo_stress`, `series_clipboard_selection`, `figure_serialization`, `series_removed_interaction_safety`) stayed at `0–4MB`.
- GPU budget telemetry remained flat in both full and isolated runs, reducing suspicion of GPU-side leaks for this repro path.
- Found and fixed QA harness teardown crash on `--list-scenarios`: early return skipped `shutdown_runtime()`, causing GLFW double-destroy during destructor path. Added explicit shutdown/reset before return in `tests/qa/qa_agent.cpp`.
- ASan remains clean for Spectra-owned allocations in this run; only known external `libdbus` LSan leak persists.

## P1 — Important Improvements

### 4. Add Vulkan Validation Layer Monitoring
- **Problem:** QA agent doesn't check for Vulkan validation errors. The `ValidationGuard` from `tests/util/validation_guard.hpp` exists but isn't used.
- **Fix:** Wrap the entire QA session in a `ValidationGuard`. Check error count after each scenario and at end of fuzzing. Report any validation errors as `IssueSeverity::Error`.
- **Priority:** P1 — this is a primary goal of the QA agent.

### 5. ~~Separate Issue Categories in Report~~ ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Report is a flat list of 93 identical-looking warnings. Hard to scan.
- **Fix applied:** Text report now has: (a) Issue Summary section grouped by category with severity counts and frame ranges. (b) Issue Details section showing first 5 per category + "... and N more" for overflow. JSON report unchanged (still flat for machine parsing).
- **Priority:** P1 — ✅ Done

### 6. Non-Deterministic Crash (Run 1 crashed, Run 2 didn't)
- **Problem:** Same seed produced different outcomes. The crash is likely a race condition or use-after-free triggered by timing differences.
- **Fix:** (a) Run with AddressSanitizer (`-fsanitize=address`) to catch UAF/buffer overflows. (b) Add a `--repeat N` flag to run the same seed N times and report crash rate. (c) Add a `--sanitizer-friendly` mode that disables screenshot capture (which does GPU readback that may race).
- **Priority:** P1 — need to reproduce and diagnose.

### 7. Memory Growth Tracking Needs Baseline Stabilization
- **Problem:** RSS grows 80-115MB over session. Unclear if this is leak or expected (figure data, GPU allocations, ImGui atlas).
- **Progress (2026-03-01):** Reduced retained RSS contamination by tearing down windows/figures after `command_exhaustion` in `tests/qa/qa_agent.cpp`; full `--no-fuzz` peak dropped `529MB -> 337MB` for seed 42. Follow-up run remains `+160MB` (`178->338`) with targeted isolation showing `command_exhaustion` at `+115MB` and other sampled scenarios at `0–4MB`.
- **Remaining fix:** (a) Take RSS baseline after first 100 frames. (b) Track RSS per-scenario directly in report. (c) Add a dedicated `--leak-check` summary mode.
- **Priority:** P1 — 🟡 In progress.

### 16. Add Acquire/Present Stall Diagnostics for ~1s Hitches
- **Problem (Session 7, seed 1771959053):** repeated ~1s frame stalls (max 1021.9ms) with profiler showing `begin_frame`/`vk_acquire` p95 near 1s.
- **Fix:** (a) Record per-window acquire/present wait times each frame. (b) Emit warnings for waits >100ms and >500ms with window id and action context. (c) Include swapchain recreate counters and `move_figure` failure correlation in report.
- **Priority:** P1 — major user-visible freeze risk.

---

## P2 — Enhancements

### 8. Add Headless Mode Support
- **Problem:** QA agent requires a display (GLFW window). Can't run in CI.
- **Fix:** Add `--headless` flag that sets `AppConfig::headless = true`. Skip GLFW-dependent scenarios. Still exercises rendering pipeline, command system, data operations.
- **Priority:** P2 — enables CI integration.

### 9. Add Per-Scenario Timing and Metrics
- **Problem:** Report only shows global frame stats. Can't tell which scenario is slow.
- **Fix:** Track per-scenario: frame count, avg/p95/max frame time, RSS delta, issue count. Add scenario breakdown table to report.
- **Priority:** P2 — better diagnostics.

### 10. Add Fuzz Action Distribution Logging
- **Problem:** Can't tell what the fuzzer was doing when a spike or crash occurred.
- **Fix:** Log action distribution histogram at end. Also maintain a ring buffer of last 20 actions so crash handler can dump recent action history.
- **Priority:** P2 — crash diagnosis.

### 11. Add `--scenario-only <name>` Isolation Mode
- **Problem:** Running all scenarios + fuzzing makes it hard to isolate issues.
- **Fix:** Already have `--scenario <name>` but it still runs fuzzing. Add `--no-fuzz` combination documentation. Also add `--fuzz-only` to skip scenarios.
- **Priority:** P2 — workflow convenience.

### 12. Swapchain Recreation Storm Detection
- **Problem:** Logs show rapid cascading swapchain recreations (OUT_OF_DATE → recreate → OUT_OF_DATE again). This is a known compositor issue but should be monitored.
- **Fix:** Count swapchain recreations per frame. Flag if > 2 recreations in a single frame as a warning.
- **Priority:** P2 — Vulkan health monitoring.

### 13. Add GPU Memory Tracking
- **Problem:** Only tracking RSS (CPU memory). GPU memory leaks are invisible.
- **Progress (2026-03-01):**
  - Added `VulkanBackend::query_gpu_memory_stats()` using VMA `vmaGetHeapBudgets()`.
  - Enabled optional `VK_EXT_memory_budget` extension in Vulkan device creation when available.
  - QA reports now include GPU memory metrics in both `qa_report.txt` and `qa_report.json` (initial/peak usage + budget for all heaps and device-local heaps).
  - Smoke verified with `--scenario rapid_figure_lifecycle --no-fuzz` (`seed 42`), reporting device-local `28MB` usage against `10966MB` budget.
- **Progress update (2026-03-01 follow-up):** Full `--no-fuzz --duration 60` and targeted isolation runs now completed. Device-local GPU usage stayed flat (`28MB -> 28MB`) including `command_exhaustion`.
- **Remaining fix:** Extend validation to known multi-window validation-error paths (`window_resize_glfw`, `window_drag_stress`) after Vulkan layout issues are addressed.
- **Priority:** P2 — 🟡 In progress.

### 14. Improve Resize Stress Scenario
- **Problem:** Current resize_stress just pumps frames — can't inject GLFW window resizes programmatically.
- **Fix:** Use `glfwSetWindowSize()` via the `GlfwAdapter` or `WindowManager` to actually trigger resize events. Test extreme sizes (1×1, 4096×4096), rapid resize sequences, and resize during animation.
- **Priority:** P2 — resize is a known fragile path.

---

## Session 3 Gaps (2026-02-26)

- [x] **Popup cleanup after screenshot** — The QA agent opens UI popups (context menus, command palette) for screenshots but didn't dismiss them, causing stale overlay in subsequent captures. Fixed by adding `close_tab_context_menu()` API. **Recommendation:** Any future scenario that opens a popup/modal should explicitly close it after capture.
- [x] **Empty figure content in detach scenarios** — Detach-to-window scenario used a figure with empty axes. Fixed by adding data before detach. **Recommendation:** All multi-window scenarios should ensure target figures have visible content.

## Backlog (Future)

- [ ] Add `--json-only` flag for CI consumption
- [ ] Add `--fail-on-warning` flag for strict mode
- [ ] Add figure screenshot comparison (golden image regression)
- [ ] Add multi-window stress scenario (open 5+ windows, close randomly)
- [ ] Add tab drag scenario (programmatic tab detach/reattach)
- [ ] Add theme switching stress test
- [ ] Add CSV import stress test (large files, malformed data)
- [ ] Add 3D-specific scenarios (orbit, surface rendering, transparency)
- [ ] Integration with Vulkan validation layer message callback (real-time, not just guard)
- [ ] Add `--profile` flag that enables frame profiler overlay data capture
